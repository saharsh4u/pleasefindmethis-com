# Meta Ads account audit

Comprehensive audit of a Meta Ads account: structure, performance, and optimization opportunities. This is a read-only workflow — it produces findings and recommendations, never applies changes. If the user approves a recommendation, route the change through the normal update tools with per-change approval.

For query mechanics (insights args, date presets, cached data vs live API), see [analytics.md](analytics.md).

## Step 1: Account overview

1. `meta_ads_ad_accounts_list` — list all ad accounts.
2. For each account in scope, note spend limits, timezone, and currency.
3. Check account status and any restrictions. If accounts are missing or errors look like permission problems, run `meta_ads_health_check()` and surface the diagnostics.

Confirm with the user which account(s) to audit if more than one is available.

## Step 2: Campaign structure review

For each account:

1. `meta_ads_campaigns_search` — list campaigns (filter to active, or include paused if the user wants a full audit).
2. Group campaigns by objective (awareness, traffic, conversions/sales, leads, app promotion).
3. Note naming conventions, duplicates, and organization — inconsistent naming and overlapping objectives are audit findings in themselves.

## Step 3: Performance analysis

Pull performance for the audit window (default: last 30 days — confirm with the user):

1. `meta_ads_insights_get` at account level (see [analytics.md](analytics.md) for args and valid `date_preset` values; prefer cached data for long windows).
2. Key metrics to capture:
   - Total spend
   - Impressions and reach
   - Click-through rate (CTR)
   - Cost per result (CPR)
   - Return on ad spend (ROAS) — only when conversion tracking is verified
3. Identify top and bottom performers by cost per result.

## Step 4: Ad set analysis

For top-spending campaigns:

1. `meta_ads_ad_sets_list` — get ad set details.
2. Review targeting settings:
   - Audience sizes (too narrow → high CPM; overlapping → auction competition)
   - Age/gender targeting
   - Interest and behavior targeting
   - Lookalike audiences
3. Check budget distribution — many small ad-set budgets under one campaign usually underperform consolidated budgets (CBO/Advantage+).
4. Check attribution windows are consistent across ad sets you compare (see the `attribution_spec` section in [constraints.md](constraints.md)).

## Step 5: Creative review

For top ad sets:

1. `meta_ads_list` — list ads; `meta_ads_get` for details.
2. Review creative types in use: static images, videos, carousels, dynamic creative.
3. Check ad fatigue: frequency > 3 over the window is a refresh signal.
4. Check UTM coverage: creatives driving to a destination without `url_tags` are unmeasurable downstream — flag them.

## Step 6: Recommendations

Based on findings, provide:

1. **Quick wins** — changes that can be made immediately (pause zero-conversion spenders, fix missing UTMs, refresh fatigued creatives).
2. **Structural changes** — longer-term improvements (consolidation, objective realignment, budget rebalancing).
3. **Testing opportunities** — new approaches to try (audiences, creative formats, placements).

Do not apply any change without explicit per-change user approval.

## Output format

Create a summary report with:

- Executive summary
- Key metrics table (spend, CTR, CPR, ROAS by campaign)
- Top/bottom performing campaigns
- Prioritized recommendations (quick wins → structural → tests)

If the user wants an interactive view, build a dashboard via [dashboards.md](dashboards.md).
