# Meta Ads: Dashboard Building

When the user asks for a Meta dashboard or performance report interface, follow the workflow below.

---

## Workflow: cached data first, then build

### 1. Use cached data

Read the Meta context block in the toolkit for the table name and last sync timestamp. Query cached data via `database_query` (the canonical SQL tool) before making any live Meta API calls.

### 2. Build the dashboard

Build the dashboard using `hyper_data_build_dashboard` with `tool_data_sources` and `sql_data_sources` (see the custom pattern below). Inspect the live tool schema before calling — it documents the accepted data-source shapes and UI components. Do not invent dashboard patterns.

### 3. Cache refresh policy

Data syncs automatically every 30 minutes. If data is stale or the user requests a refresh, call `meta_business_sync` with no parameters. This is a background refresh — do not wait for completion.

If no cached data exists yet, use Meta API tools directly as a fallback and cache the results.

---

## Custom dashboard pattern

Use `tool_data_sources` to fetch from Meta API and save to a cache table. Use `sql_data_sources` to query the cache for UI variables. Pass `scalar` or `rows` shapes explicitly — do not embed raw SQL in UI props.

```python
hyper_data_build_dashboard(
    name="Meta Ads Performance",
    tool_data_sources={
        "meta_campaigns": {
            "tool_name": "meta_ads_insights_get",
            "tool_args": {
                "object_id": "act_123456789",
                "object_type": "account",
                "level": "campaign",
                "date_preset": "last_30d",
                "include_actions": True
            },
            "cache_table": "meta_campaign_perf_30d",
            "mode": "replace"
        }
    },
    sql_data_sources={
        "spend_by_campaign": {
            "query": "SELECT campaign_name, SUM(spend) as spend FROM meta_campaign_perf_30d GROUP BY campaign_name ORDER BY spend DESC",
            "shape": "rows"
        },
        "total_spend": {
            "query": "SELECT SUM(spend) as total FROM meta_campaign_perf_30d",
            "shape": "scalar"
        }
    },
    prefab_python="..."
)
```

Do not inject Meta API credentials into the dashboard/data app runtime.

Keep custom dashboards focused on the user's question. Do not add extra panels or metrics unless asked.

Do not mention internal dashboard implementation details to the user unless they explicitly ask.

## Ad preview handling

After campaign creation, call `meta_ads_ad_previews_get(creative_ids=["<creative_id>"])` — the creative_id comes from the ad creation response (`response.creative.id`). Note: `ad_id` is not a valid parameter.

- Never paste or render iframe/html preview snippets directly in chat.
- Summarize which preview formats succeeded or failed.
- Direct the user to the UI artifact to view previews.
